### Overview

Covered is a platform designed to connect newly arrived Australians to career mentors. Job seeking individuals can sign up, fill out some information and have a resume generated at the click of a button. They will be put in touch with an industry professional who will reach out and provide feedback on their resume. The seeker then has the opportunity to set up a 'mock interview' and discuss other aspects of the job application process with their mentor.

This project was developed over the weekend of 5-6 November 2016, as part of [Techfugees](https://techfugees.com/).

The prototype was tested with refugees & newly arrived Australians and was identified as a tool which would be useful in the job search process.


### Specs & Version
This is version 1.0.0

The app is built in Ruby on Rails


### Future Considerations / TODOs
* Fix User inheritance so that mentors and seekers can both sign up and have different views within the app
* Admin functionality
* Randomised matching of mentors with seekers based on industry
