      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      Covered was born out of the Techfugees Hackathon, which took place in Sydney in 2016. Placing second, the team decided to pursue their idea and build out the Covered platform to pair New Australians with career coaches and help them get their foot in the door.<br><br>
      We understand that finding work in Australia is hard, and it's even harder when you are dealing with cultural differences, language barriers, and discrimination. We help our job seekers to get application ready, first by building a properly formatted resume, and then by pairing them up with a career mentor. Our career mentors are working professionals who work in recruitment, human resources, and hiring roles. They know what they're looking for when they're hiring, and they can help our candidates to position themselves for the Australian job market.

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      It's simple! We'll grab a few of your details and then take you through some straightforward questions to help you build out your resume. When you're happy with it, we'll match you up with the perfect career coach and send it off to them for review. Within a week, you'll have specific feedback, and you'll then have the opportunity to set up some time to go through some mock-interview questions and tips with your mentor.
